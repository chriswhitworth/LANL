I encourage those who are interested in this work to read the conference paper "VISIO-ACOUSTIC DATA FUSION" contained in this 
repository. Work was conducted at the 20th Los Alamos Dynamic Summer School at Los Alamos National Laboratory. All necessary 
code is provided to run with your own microphone and video data. Original microphone and video data used in the experiments 
conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory is not contained within this repository. Original work is contained within the MATLAB
.m files "VISIO_ACOUSTIC_DATA_FUSION_PROJECT_v1.m", "VISIO_ACOUSTIC_DATA_FUSION_PROJECT_v2.m", 
"VISIO_ACOUSTIC_DATA_FUSION_PROJECT_Octave.m", "VISIO_ACOUSTIC_DATA_FUSION_PROJECT_Gabor.m", and 
"VISIO_ACOUSTIC_DATA_FUSION_PROJECT_users2.m". All additinal MATLAB files and functions needed to run original .m files is 
included in the repository. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions.
